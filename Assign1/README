1. checks if local repo is up to date with the remote repo. Made an if then statement because it looks cleaner than just outputting git remote show origin

2. Puts uncommited changes in a file changes.log. Note, this removes previous content of changes.log

3. Puts each Line from every file containing #TODO in a todo.log

4. Finds the errors in the haskell files present. I made an if then statement in case there were no haskell files, which would normally give an error.

5. Finds the errors in python files. I just used the haskell feature, but changed "ghc -fno-code" to "python -m py_compile"
	I found the python compliling function at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4284313/how-can-i-check-the-syntax-of-python-script-without-executing-it

6. Asks if you would like to clone a repo

7. If you're local repo isnt up to date with the remote repo, it asks if you want to do a git push. If you are up to date it doesnt do anything

8. Shows how much space you have used in your account. "| tail -n1 | sed 's/\<total\>//g' | sed 's/\<M\>//g'" is just formatting to get it how i wanted it.
	I got the formatting information from http://www.linfo.org/tail.html

9. A tool that makes the process of using grep or find more intuitive. You can search in the current directory, a specified one or from the root
